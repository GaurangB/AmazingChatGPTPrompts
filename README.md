# Amazing ChatGPT Prompts 
### Test Automation Framework

ChatGPT can help you create the desired test automation framework using the language and technology stack of your choice. I used the following prompt to generate a basic framework and then integrated other tools as needed:

Prompt: `Create a boilerplate Selenium WebDriver 4 testing framework using TestNG, Java, and Maven that can handle parallel execution and generate an Extent report. Add API testing with Rest Assured and include an example test for both UI and API.`

To get the most out of ChatGPT, you may need to adjust the follow-up prompts to meet your specific needs. 

For example, I needed to add a `testng.xml` and `pom.xml` file, so I asked ChatGPT to generate these files. 

Then, I asked it to `integrate an Extent report into the project.`

You can customize the prompts to suit your needs, such as `update the project to read user credentials from a user.properties file`, `add code to rerun failed tests`, or `integrating with Azure to update Test Cases`. 

There may be some hiccups along the way, such as when ChatGPT had trouble generating the AzureTestCaseUpdater class. In these cases, you can ask for it to `print complete class without explanations`.

What I loved about using ChatGPT was that I was able to generate a beautiful readme.md file that included all the features of my project with a simple prompt.

`generate a readme.md` and since it had the context of all the previous prompts and responses it did it nicely!

### Health Coach

ChatGPT can `act as a health coach` or assume any other role you would like it to play.

prompt:`Act as my personal health coach`

response: _Of course! As your personal health coach, I'll do my best to provide you with helpful and practical advice for improving your physical and mental health. What specific areas would you like to focus on? Diet, exercise, stress management, or something else?_

prompt: `What type of food should a heart healthy diet have? `

prompt: `Make a table of vegetarian recipes`

prompt: `Besides diet what should you consider`

prompt: `Is peanut butter good? `

prompt: `Is paneer high in cholesterol`

You can find some answers to these questions by using a search engine like Google. However, what's unique here is the context that ChatGPT has and the perspective of a health coach that it can provide.

### Spanish Tutor

prompt: `could you please help me practice a basic conversation in Spanish where we talk to each other? Imagine we just met. You will start the conversation off and wait for me to respond. Please translate each response to English`

response: _Sure! Let's start._

_Me: Hola, ¿cómo estás? (Hello, how are you?)_

_You: Estoy bien, ¿y tú? (I'm good, and you?)_

_Me: Estoy bien también, gracias. ¿De dónde eres? (I'm also good, thank you. Where are you from?)_

_You: Soy de los Estados Unidos. ¿Y tú? (I'm from the United States. And you?)_

_Me: Soy de España. ¿Qué te gusta hacer en tu tiempo libre? (I'm from Spain. What do you like to do in your free time?)_

_And so on! Let the conversation flow naturally from here._

### 4th Grade Math Tutor

prompt: `generate an assessment to test math skills for a 4th grader by asking a set of questions`

You can continue the conversation by asking for more assessments, practice tests, etc.
