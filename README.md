### Test Automation Framework

With ChatGPT's assistance, you can build the test automation framework of your choice, utilizing the preferred language and technology stack. I utilized the following prompt to construct a basic framework, then added additional tools as required.

prompt: `Create a boilerplate Selenium WebDriver 4 testing framework using TestNG, Java, and Maven that can handle parallel execution and generate an Extent report. Add API testing with Rest Assured and include an example test for both UI and API.`

For optimal results with ChatGPT, you may have to tailor the subsequent prompts to fit your specific requirements. For instance, I needed to include `testng.xml` and `pom.xml` files, so I requested ChatGPT to create them.

Next, I asked ChatGPT to integrate an Extent report into the project.

You can tailor the prompts to meet your specific requirements, such as updating the project to retrieve user credentials from a `user.properties` file, incorporating code to re-run failed tests, or integrating with Azure to update test case results.

Occasionally, there may be challenges, such as when ChatGPT encountered difficulties generating the AzureTestCaseUpdater class. In such instances, you can request it to `print the complete class without any explanations.`

One of the aspects I appreciated about using ChatGPT was its ability to create a comprehensive readme.md file that showcased all the features of my project, with just a simple prompt.

`generate a readme.md` Thanks to the context of all previous prompts and responses, ChatGPT was able to produce a great result!

### Health Coach

ChatGPT can `act as a health coach` or assume any other role you would like it to play.

prompt:`Act as my personal health coach`

response: _Of course! As your personal health coach, I'll do my best to provide you with helpful and practical advice for improving your physical and mental health. What specific areas would you like to focus on? Diet, exercise, stress management, or something else?_

prompt: `What type of food should a heart healthy diet have? `

prompt: `Make a table of vegetarian recipes`

prompt: `Besides diet what should you consider`

prompt: `Is peanut butter good? `

prompt: `Is paneer high in cholesterol`

You can find some answers to these questions by using a search engine like Google. However, what's unique here is the context that ChatGPT has and the perspective of a health coach that it can provide.
