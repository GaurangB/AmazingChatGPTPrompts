# Amazing ChatGPT Prompts 
### Test Automation Framework

ChatGPT can help you create the desired test automation framework using the language and technology stack of your choice. I used the following prompt to generate a basic framework and then integrated other tools as needed:

Prompt: `Create a boilerplate Selenium WebDriver 4 testing framework using TestNG, Java, and Maven that can handle parallel execution and generate an Extent report. Add API testing with Rest Assured and include an example test for both UI and API.`

To get the most out of ChatGPT, you may need to adjust the follow-up prompts to meet your specific needs. 

For example, I needed to add a `testng.xml` and `pom.xml` file, so I asked ChatGPT to generate these files. 

Then, I asked it to `integrate an Extent report into the project.`

You can customize the prompts to suit your needs, such as `update the project to read user credentials from a user.properties file`, `add code to rerun failed tests`, or `integrating with Azure to update Test Cases`. 

There may be some hiccups along the way, such as when ChatGPT had trouble generating the AzureTestCaseUpdater class. In these cases, you can ask for it to `print complete class without explanations`.

What I loved about using ChatGPT was that I was able to generate a beautiful readme.md file that included all the features of my project with a simple prompt.

`generate a readme.md` and since it had the context of all the previous prompts and responses it did it nicely!
